## Study Guide: Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

This guide is designed to help you master the rules and applications of trigonometric derivatives, a cornerstone of 11th-grade calculus.

---

### 1. Learning Objectives

- Develop a comprehensive understanding of the derivative rules for all six trigonometric functions.
- Apply the Chain Rule and Product Rule in conjunction with trigonometric derivatives.
- Gain the ability to differentiate complex expressions involving sine, cosine, and tangent with accuracy and confidence.

---

### 2. Important Vocabulary and Terms

- **Derivative:** The instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.
- **Trigonometric Function:** A function (like sine or cosine) that relates the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.
- **Radian:** The standard unit of angular measure used in calculus; derivatives of trig functions are valid only when the angle is measured in radians.
- **Differentiable:** A property of a function that has a derivative at every point in its domain.
- **Chain Rule:** A formula for calculating the derivative of a composite function, often necessary when the "inside" of a trig function is more than just a simple $x$.

### 3. Introduction to Trigonometric Derivatives

Trigonometric derivatives allow us to model periodic behavior, such as sound waves or planetary motion. Key points to remember include:

- The derivative of a trigonometric function is always another trigonometric (or related) function.
- Functions starting with "co-" (cosine, cotangent, cosecant) always result in a negative derivative.
- These rules are derived using the limit definition of a derivative and specific trigonometric identities.
- Consistency is key: always ensure your calculator and your logic are set to **radian mode** when working with these calculus concepts.

### 4. Step-by-Step Breakdown

To master this concept, follow these logical steps:

**Step 1: Memorize the Primary Derivatives**
You must know the "Big Three" perfectly before moving forward:

1. $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x$
2. $\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) = -\sin x$
3. $\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) = \sec^2 x$

**Step 2: Learn the Reciprocal Derivatives**
Once the basics are set, memorize the remaining three:

1. $\frac{d}{dx}(\csc x) = -\csc x \cot x$
2. $\frac{d}{dx}(\sec x) = \sec x \tan x$
3. $\frac{d}{dx}(\cot x) = -\csc^2 x$

**Step 3: Identify the "Inside" Function (The Chain Rule)**
In most 11th-grade problems, you won't just see $\sin(x)$. You will see $\sin(5x^2)$. You must differentiate the "outside" (the sine) while keeping the "inside" (the $5x^2$) the same, then multiply by the derivative of that inside piece.

**Step 4: Combine with Algebra**
Apply the Product Rule or Quotient Rule if the trigonometric function is being multiplied or divided by another function, such as $x^2 \sin x$.

### 5. Examples of the Concepts

**Example A: Simple Application**
Find the derivative of $f(x) = 3\cos x + \sin x$.

- Using the sum rule and basic identities:
- $f'(x) = 3(-\sin x) + \cos x$
- $f'(x) = -3\sin x + \cos x$

**Example B: Using the Chain Rule**
Find the derivative of $y = \tan(4x^3)$.

- Identify the outer function: $\tan(u)$. Its derivative is $\sec^2(u)$.
- Identify the inner function: $u = 4x^3$. Its derivative is $12x^2$.
- Combine them: $y' = \sec^2(4x^3) \cdot 12x^2$.
- Final Answer: $y' = 12x^2 \sec^2(4x^3)$.

**Example C: The Power Rule with Trig**
Find the derivative of $f(x) = \sin^2(x)$.

- Rewrite the function as $f(x) = (\sin x)^2$.
- Bring the power down: $2(\sin x)^1$.
- Multiply by the derivative of the inside ($\sin x$): $\cos x$.
- Final Answer: $f'(x) = 2\sin x \cos x$.

### 6. Summary

This guide outlines the essential rules for differentiating trigonometric functions and explains how to integrate them with the Chain Rule for complex problems. By mastering these six fundamental derivatives and recognizing when to apply inner-function differentiation, you can solve any trigonometric rate-of-change problem.

Would you like me to provide a few practice problems based on these specific examples?
