# About Me
## Who I Am
My name is Rayhan Ahmed, and I am currently a High School Junior at Corner Canyon High School. What most interests me in AI is how revolutionary it is with all the 
possibilities it can bring to the world, from automating requests to generating solutions for applications in many different fields. I think it could have a major 
impact on our society by making us more technologically advanced. Still, I also want the world to be more responsible and careful about placing too much faith in AI. 
This is why I am interested in AI, because I want to contribute to the potential technological benefits it could bring while also teaching how to use it responsibly.

I mainly want to focus on generating solutions for real-world problems, such as economic recessions or stock crashes, and also environmental problems, such as global 
warming and efficient conservation methods. This is what I think is the best way to use AI due to the convenience it could bring to making a difference.

I am making this portfolio to work towards a career in programming, computer science, and AI engineering, which is why I value this portfolio, as it is one step 
towards a career in technology. I have been interested in computers since middle school, and I always felt like technology was important to progression, which is
why I am most interested in this career field. I am currently learning programming in Java, C++, and HTML to get a good understanding of computer science.

Key Focus Areas:
- Programming
- Analyzing Data
- Prompt Engineering/Machine Learning
- Web Development

## What Drives Me
I am looking to solve real-world and economic problems using AI, because currently, the world seems to be in a state of turmoil, and I want to use AI to develop efficient 
solutions to alleviate most of these problems. They matter to me personally since seeing these problems has made me realize the detrimental effects that have 
been brought upon our world, which is why I want to help with the skills I learn from AI. I am hoping to cross over AI with the economy and business, as well as 
environmental sciences, and I hope that AI can be used to solve problems that can be solved through enough effort put into them in the world.

## About This Portfolio
This portfolio contains different prompts that work for different applications, such as education and business, and gives the most comprehensive output possible
which has been verified with a prompt checker. I used mainly the CARE framework for them due to the context, and gave the most detailed placeholders possible to
maximize the chances for a quality result.

My Approach:
I mainly experimented with my first prompt and found that the CARE framework worked best, so I implemented that across my prompts and modified each prompt with 
appropriate placeholders.

## My Current Focus
**Learning:**
- Programming with Java and C++
- Develop websites with HTML
- AI Prompt Engineering
**Building:**
- Website project for educational resources with a team
- AI Prompts for different applications
**Exploring:**
- Machine Learning
- Software Development
- Data Analysis
## Skills & Tools
**Prompt Engineering:**
- CARE Framework
- Implement placeholders wherever needed for extra guidance
## My Learning Philosophy
I believe in:
- **Experimenting to find the best solution.** - It is best to find out what works for yourself, as that is one of the best ways to learn.
- **Only using AI for enrichment and progression.** - AI is revolutionary, meaning it should be handled with intent and only used for beneficial impact and intent. 
## Beyond AI
When I'm not working with AI:
- I usually spend time with my friends.
- Watch TV and play video games.
## What's Next
**Short-term (This Semester):**
- Get straight A's
- Develop a firm understanding of AI theory
- Enhance my programming skills
**Medium-term (This Year):**
